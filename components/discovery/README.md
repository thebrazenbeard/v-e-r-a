# Discovery

Discovery exists to **discover useful capability across the portfolio and get it governably implemented into Vera and Vera Control Plane**.

Its core loop is:

`DISCOVER -> CLASSIFY -> IMPLEMENT -> VERIFY -> HAND OFF`

Reuse/deduplication is one part of that mission, not the whole mission. Discovery must also identify valuable standalone capabilities, decide how they belong in Vera/VCP, prepare the concrete integration work, and verify source-level implementation without confusing source integration with installation or runtime activation.

Repository sprawl is not automatically a defect. Duplication can provide evolutionary isolation, fault containment, independent falsification, and freedom to challenge assumptions.

Discovery therefore does **not** begin with a universal framework. It begins with competing hypotheses and forces proposed shared infrastructure to earn promotion through real consumers, measured simplification, exact evidence, rollbackability, and hostile review.

## Core rule

**No abstraction is promoted because it looks elegant.**

A candidate shared mechanism must demonstrate that it:

1. serves at least two materially independent consumers;
2. removes more complexity than it introduces;
3. preserves each consumer's semantic ownership and authority boundaries;
4. can fail without taking unrelated projects down with it;
5. has an explicit fallback or rollback path;
6. survives a hostile review that tries to prove the abstraction should not exist.

## Candidate states

`OBSERVED` → `HYPOTHESIS` → `EXPERIMENTING` → `PROVEN_REUSABLE`

A candidate may instead become `PROJECT_SPECIFIC`, `REJECTED`, or `SUPERSEDED`.

`PROVEN_REUSABLE` is evidence of reuse suitability only. It grants no merge, deployment, installation, authority, or semantic promotion elsewhere.

See [docs/DISCOVERY_PROTOCOL_V1.md](docs/DISCOVERY_PROTOCOL_V1.md) and [docs/DISCOVERY_VERA_VCP_IMPLEMENTATION_ENGINE_V1.md](docs/DISCOVERY_VERA_VCP_IMPLEMENTATION_ENGINE_V1.md).

## Portfolio census

Discovery's search space is the **whole accessible portfolio**, not a hand-picked list of favored projects.

Current live inventory cut (2026-09-27):

- **71 repositories observed**;
- **69 active** and **2 archived**;
- **53 public repositories** named in the V2 public census;
- **18 private repositories** included in aggregate counts and digest commitments but intentionally not named here;
- exact sorted-name inventory digests recorded so future scans can detect portfolio drift without publishing private repository names.

The earlier V1 census and its exact-head public observatory remain historical, internally coupled evidence for their older cut; they are not relabeled as current merely because the membership census advanced.

## Operational public observatory

The existing V1 public observatory is **historical exact-head evidence for its bound public cut**, not a current 53-public-repository scan. Its read-only mechanics remain useful, but the blob shards, pair counts, relationship graph, and intake bindings must be regenerated together before they can claim the 2026-09-27 public estate.

Its operational loop is:

1. `tools/check_public_currentness.py` reads the live public GitHub estate and compares repository membership, default branch, exact commit, exact tree, and archive state with the bound public evidence.
2. When drift is found, `tools/trace_public_impact.py` identifies Discovery artifacts that still contain exact references to the stale commit SHA.
3. When the public subjects are current, `tools/refresh_public_blob_evidence.py --check` reacquires all 23 exact Git trees and must reproduce both public blob-index shards and the 253-pair overlap scan byte-for-byte.
4. `.github/workflows/discovery-public-currentness.yml` runs the live check every six hours after landing, on demand, and on relevant pull requests.

The workflow never refreshes evidence automatically. A stale result is a review trigger, not mutation authority.

Public currentness is intentionally not whole-portfolio currentness: the public watcher does not inspect or identify private repositories.

See:

- [docs/PUBLIC_CURRENTNESS_WATCH_V1.md](docs/PUBLIC_CURRENTNESS_WATCH_V1.md)
- [docs/PUBLIC_BLOB_REPRODUCIBILITY_V1.md](docs/PUBLIC_BLOB_REPRODUCIBILITY_V1.md)
- [docs/DISCOVERY_ARCHITECTURE_OBSERVATORY_V1.md](docs/DISCOVERY_ARCHITECTURE_OBSERVATORY_V1.md)

## Initial experiments

The first three candidates deliberately test different kinds of reuse:

- **Rezon ↔ Project Runner:** can epistemic reasoning remain independent while delegating mechanical execution?
- **HC Brain ↔ Transcendence:** can duplicated base implementation be replaced by exact base + overlay reconstruction without destroying provenance or experimental independence?
- **Private evidence-custody system ↔ two consumers:** can evidence custody/interchange be reused without creating a global truth database?

They are the first experiments, not the complete scope.

The broader census identifies additional candidate families around execution integrity, evidence/provenance, coordination transport, cognitive-base overlap, experimental mechanics, runtime/control separation, industrial diagnostics, and domain-specific negative controls.

These remain hypotheses until individual candidates earn promotion under the Discovery Protocol.


## 2026-09-21 public-surface intake

The latest census made eleven previously unnamed public repositories available for direct public-safe classification. Discovery has not treated visibility change as architectural promotion.

The first exact remeasurement found:

- `god-brain` vs `hc-brain`: 299/300 same-path blobs identical; only `README.md` differs at the measured heads; identical bytes equal 99.54245136% of the measured HC byte surface.
- `bt2` vs `hc-brain`: 178 identical same-path blobs, 10 changed same-path blobs, plus substantial unique surfaces on both sides; identical bytes equal 46.14031461% of the measured HC byte surface.

Those observations generated `HC_FAMILY_LINEAGE_V1` as a HYPOTHESIS, not a consolidation decision.

The same intake exposes public anchors for previously opaque families including industrial diagnostics (`abil`), semantic grounding/provenance (`semanticatlas`, `spm`, `unvtrslr`), and Vera transport/runtime packaging (`vera-mesh`, `vera-synology`).

The second-pass source review narrows those frontiers further:

- `VERAMESH_SYNOLOGY_HANDOFF_V1` is now a HYPOTHESIS for a neutral source/build/install/runtime-currentness handoff; transport/session authority remains VeraMesh-owned and package/install authority remains Vera Synology-owned.
- the public industrial handoff frontier remains held because no defensible second public industrial subject was found on the current cut;
- `voss` remains `INSUFFICIENT_PUBLIC_SOURCE_NO_CANDIDATE` rather than being promoted from a role label alone.

See `experiments/PUBLIC_INTAKE_SECOND_PASS_V1.*` for the source-bound dispositions.

A portfolio-wide exact blob scan now binds all 23 public repositories at exact default heads and computes all 253 unordered pairs. On that cut, only six pairs share any Git blob SHA at all, and those six are exactly the complete `bt2` / `god-brain` / `hc-brain` / `transcendence` clique. The other 247 pairs share zero blob SHAs. Discovery recomputes this result in `tools/validate_discovery.py`; it is byte-identity evidence, not lineage or consolidation authority.

See `experiments/PUBLIC_BLOB_OVERLAP_SCAN_V1.*` and `experiments/public_blob_index_v1/`.

The HC-family lineage pass now extends beyond `main`:

- HC / Transcendence / God Brain share 35 live branch names;
- all **34 non-`main` common branches** have identical blob path/SHA snapshots across all three;
- on every one of those 34 branches, HC has the earlier parented commit, while Transcendence and God Brain later re-root the identical Git tree as parentless `Initialize <branch>` commits;
- `main` is the only common-branch content divergence surface on the observed cut;
- bt2 remains byte-related but topologically distinct, sharing only `main` by branch name with the other three.

This is strong historical source-side evidence for HC snapshots, not a consolidation decision and not proof of the direct transfer path to God Brain.
