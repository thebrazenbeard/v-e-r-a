## Question

Is there one reusable execution-integrity subsystem hiding in both projects?

Initial answer: **not at that breadth**.

The exact artifacts show two different state machines with a narrower common mechanical seam.

## What overlaps

### Target + precondition

Runner GitHub requests bind repository/ref/path plus expected head and, where relevant, expected blob SHA.

WIP operation events bind a target locator plus optional expected precondition.

This is a real common invariant:

> a consequential effect should identify its target and the state expected immediately before the effect.

### Post-effect uncertainty

Runner can end verification in `OUTCOME_UNKNOWN` when current subject state or completion authority cannot be established.

WIP has `AMBIGUOUS` and requires inspection before retry.

These are not byte-for-byte identical states, but they represent the same operational danger:

> an effect may have occurred even though completion cannot yet be safely claimed.

### Readback

Runner's GitHub backend performs explicit post-write ref/file readback and returns evidence.

WIP requires an `effect_receipt` for `VERIFIED` and `RECONCILED`, with optional readback text.

Both reject “tool call returned” as sufficient completion evidence.

## What does **not** belong in the shared layer

### Runner-only semantics

- work graph/frontier;
- collision grouping;
- recursive budgets;
- backend capability and target authority;
- lease ownership;
- monotonic fencing token;
- work completion state.

### WIP-only semantics

- workspace identity;
- checkpoint cadence;
- continuation/resume projection;
- append-only operation history;
- workspace lifecycle;
- explicit recovery instruction.

Trying to put all of these into one shared state machine would create a worse abstraction than the duplication it replaces.

## Narrowed experiment

The surviving hypothesis is a tiny **effect-attempt interchange envelope**.

It should carry only:

- source system + source-native operation ID/state;
- action class;
- target locator;
- expected precondition;
- normalized effect phase;
- effect/readback receipts;
- retry disposition;
- source payload digest/ref.

Proposed V0 schema: `schemas/effect_attempt_envelope_v0.schema.json`.

This schema is an experiment artifact, not a new dependency.

## Mapping hypothesis

WIP:
- `PREPARED` → `PRE_EFFECT`
- `ATTEMPTED` → `POST_EFFECT_UNVERIFIED`
- `VERIFIED` → `POST_EFFECT_VERIFIED`
- `FAILED` → `TERMINAL_FAILURE`
- `AMBIGUOUS` → `OUTCOME_UNKNOWN`
- `RECONCILED` → `RECONCILED`

Runner:
- exact request before backend execution → `PRE_EFFECT`
- backend success before independent verification → `POST_EFFECT_UNVERIFIED`
- `COMPLETE` → `POST_EFFECT_VERIFIED`
- deterministic backend/verification failure → `TERMINAL_FAILURE`
- `OUTCOME_UNKNOWN` → `OUTCOME_UNKNOWN`

Runner `VERIFYING` remains source-native detail attached to `POST_EFFECT_UNVERIFIED`; Runner `SUPERSEDED` is not an effect outcome and must remain outside the normalized phase.

## Rejection test

Kill this abstraction if either adapter must:

- hide source-native state;
- encode Runner lease/fence semantics;
- encode WIP workspace/checkpoint semantics;
- turn `SUPERSEDED` into an effect outcome;
- make the envelope authoritative for retry or completion;
- require either project to depend on Discovery at runtime.

## Current result

**PARTIAL SUPPORT / NARROWED.**

The original “shared execution-integrity subsystem” hypothesis was too broad.

A small effect-attempt interchange envelope remains plausible. No shared library is justified yet.

> **HOSTILE REVIEWER:** A common envelope can still become schema theater: two systems can serialize into the same shape without eliminating a single line of duplicated implementation. Promotion requires a real consumer workflow where the envelope removes translation or recovery code while preserving both native state machines.

## Third-consumer test — DriftGuard

Exact DriftGuard subject:

- native R4 base: `one/driftguard-r4-windows-eol-v1-20260919@e815c75ffccf469d9d1c09d58c0050798c8e4f53`;
- consumer adapter: `work/discovery-effect-envelope-consumer-v1-20260920@976f50ca391560d16ebcdcfe478df28b1cd1efca`;
- adapter Git blob: `2904452b0f14a444c28a616e2e8963bab0f05ac6`;
- regression Git blob: `2e205d299d440e8d9531246b3eb8fc94fe03cf48`;
- hosted run `35510133549`: SUCCESS on Ubuntu and Windows.

DriftGuard is a materially different semantic test because it distinguishes:

1. reload decision;
2. accepted downstream reload acknowledgement;
3. behavioral evidence that recovery actually occurred.

Its native V1 source implements the first two and explicitly says acknowledgement is a caller assertion, not behavioral proof.

The unchanged V0 envelope handles this without importing DriftGuard semantics:

- committed reload-required evaluation → `PRE_EFFECT`;
- accepted reload acknowledgement → `POST_EFFECT_UNVERIFIED`;
- there is deliberately no DriftGuard adapter path to `POST_EFFECT_VERIFIED`.

That mapping is important. Treating acknowledgement as `POST_EFFECT_VERIFIED` would be a semantic-laundering failure and would reject the abstraction.

The adapter is dependency-free and one-way. DriftGuard does not import Discovery and does not consume the envelope for decisions, retry, acknowledgement, or recovery.

## V0 schema stability

The third consumer required **no change** to `schemas/effect_attempt_envelope_v0.schema.json`.

Bound V0 Git blob remains `b5d85ba31a33ad7192fd4a08934628a72e593312`.

This is stronger evidence than adding a DriftGuard-specific field to the shared shape.

## Three-consumer result

Current result:

**THREE_CONSUMER_INTEROPERABILITY_SUPPORTED / BROAD_SHARED_STATE_MACHINE_REJECTED / REUSE_VALUE_UNMEASURED.**

The narrow envelope now survives three different source-native state machines without becoming authoritative over them.

That still does not justify a shared library.

The remaining central hostile objection is economic/operational rather than syntactic:

> Does extracting this envelope actually remove duplicated translation, validation, recovery, or custody work across real workflows, or does it merely add adapters and schema ceremony?

Until an experiment measures a net reduction while preserving standalone operation, the candidate remains `EXPERIMENTING`, not `PROVEN_REUSABLE`.
